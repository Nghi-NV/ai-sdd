## 🎯 Key Topics

This seminar covers the essential pillars of modern AI-assisted development:

### 1. 🛠️ AI Tools Ecosystem
- **Cursor IDE**: Advanced code editor with built-in AI chat, composer, and inline editing.
- **Antigravity (Google DeepMind)**: Powerful agentic AI for planning, execution, and verification.

### 2. ✍️ Prompt Engineering
- Moving beyond "random" prompts.
- Structured templates: **Context → Task → Constraints → Examples**.
- Best practices to avoid common pitfalls.

### 3. 📋 Spec-Driven Development (SDD)
- **Philosophy**: "Spec first, code later."
- **Spec-Kit Workflow**:
    1.  `Specify`: Define WHAT and WHY.
    2.  `Plan`: AI allows you to architect the solution.
    3.  `Implement`: AI generates code based on strict specs.

### 4. 🚀 BMAD Method
- **Build More, Architect Dreams**.
- A 4-phase agile workflow: **Analysis → Planning → Solutioning → Implementation**.
- Leveraging specialized AI agents for each phase.
